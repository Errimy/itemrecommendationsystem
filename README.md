## Item Recommendation System

Welcome to the Item Recommendation System repository, this project revolves around building a Collaborative Filtering recommendation system. Collaborative filtering is a technique commonly used in recommendation systems to make predictions about the preferences or interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file hosted on Google Colab that is divided into three main parts.

### Part 1: Data Pre-processing

In this section, the data undergoes thorough cleaning and pre-processing using Pandas. Data cleaning is a crucial step to ensure that the data used for analysis and modeling is accurate and reliable. Pandas provides essential tools for tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.

### Part 2: Data Analysis

This section delves into a deeper understanding of the dataset through data visualization techniques using Matplotlib. Visualization is a powerful tool for gaining insights from data. By creating visual representations of the data, patterns and trends within the dataset become more apparent. These visual insights are invaluable for making informed decisions during the recommendation system creation process.

### Part 3: Machine Learning

In the final section, the recommendation system is developed using SciPy and Surprise. SciPy is a library in Python used for scientific and technical computing, while Surprise is specifically designed for building and analyzing recommendation systems. The collaborative filtering technique is applied here, where the system makes predictions by seeking similarities between users. This machine learning approach enables the system to generate accurate recommendations.
